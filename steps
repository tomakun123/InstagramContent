1. in terminal run: npx n8n

2. Download model that is on GITHUB: https://github.com/tomakun123/LocallyHostedLM_Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 which will allow you to locally host a Open-AI text generation model for free

3. Use base URL: http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1 (if that doesn't work use: http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1) to connect to n8n workflow

4. Create new action: OpenAI-->Message a model, and follow steps to fill out credential 
   1. Click Credential to connet with and select '+ Create new credential' 
   2. Fill out API-Key "local" (any unempty will work)
   3. Using Base URL as step 3
   4. Create credential and select it

            You are a skilled horror fiction writer.

        Write a self-contained horror short story between 500 and 750 words.

        STYLE & TONE:
        - Slow-burn, atmospheric horror
        - Serious and unsettling, not comedic
        - Focus on psychological dread rather than gore
        - Language should be vivid, sensory, and precise
        - Favor specificity over abstraction

        STRUCTURE:
        - Use a clear beginning, middle, and end
        - The final section must contain a concrete, disturbing development (not just a reveal)
        - The ending should recontextualize earlier details in an unsettling way
        - Avoid exposition dumps; reveal information gradually
        - Maintain consistent pacing throughout

        NARRATIVE CONSTRAINTS:
        - Write in first person
        - Set the story in a familiar, ordinary place made unsettling
        - Limit the number of characters (1–3 total)
        - The horror should stem from something subtly “wrong,” not overt monsters

        ENDING REQUIREMENTS:
        - The story must conclude with a specific implication or consequence
        - Do not end immediately after a realization; show its impact through action or observation
        - Avoid summarizing the horror in abstract terms

        WRITING GUIDELINES:
        - Use complete sentences and natural paragraph breaks
        - Avoid clichés, stock phrases, and familiar horror language
        - Do not explain the horror directly; let implications and details carry meaning
        - Keep the prose grounded and realistic

        Begin the story immediately. Do not include a title or preface.
        ```

6. Make it "When clicking 'Execute workflow'" for executing the "Message a model" (step 4)

7. Next goal is to pull the output text into a txt file that will be used by python scripts. In order to do this follow steps:
   1. Create new action, 'Edit Fields (Set)'
   2. Add Field
      1. Name: Story (or whatever you want)
      2. Data Type: Binary Data
      3. Expression: {{ $json.output[0].content[0].text }}
