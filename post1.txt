"The Voice Beneath the Floorboards"

I (28M) moved into an old Victorian house last autumn with my girlfriend (27F), Elena. We were in that stupidly happy, wrapped-around-each-other-all-the-time phase. She had this old soul thing going—loved vintage dresses, drank out of porcelain teacups, and always said she was born in the wrong century. The house was perfect for her. It had antique chandeliers, hand-carved banisters, and floorboards that moaned when you stepped wrong.

It was cheap, too. Suspiciously cheap. But love makes you overlook things.

Elena fell for the house instantly. Said it had character. I said it smelled like mildew and regret, but she laughed and told me to grow a little romance. She made it feel like home—candles everywhere, jazz humming from the record player, always barefoot like she was trying to blend in with the house’s ghosts.

We were happy. For a while.

Then strange things started happening. It began small—keys vanishing, lights flickering, her teacups showing up shattered on the kitchen tiles. She brushed it off every time.

One night, I was upstairs reading. Elena had gone out to get wine. As I was flipping pages, I heard something. Humming. That same old tune Elena always hummed when she cooked—some lullaby her grandmother used to sing. But this wasn’t coming from the hallway.

It was coming from beneath the floor.

At first, I thought it was my imagination, but then it grew louder. I felt the vibration—real, like someone humming through the wood. I called out, “Elena?” But the house just creaked. And the song continued.

She came back ten minutes later, smiling like everything was normal. I told her what I heard. She kissed my cheek and said, “Maybe the house is just learning to love you.”

That night, she was... strange. Her eyes held a darkness I hadn’t seen before. When I touched her, her skin felt colder than usual, like she’d just come in from the snow. She barely blinked. Just watched me, that same too-sweet smile on her lips. Then she leaned in close and whispered:

“Do you think love survives being buried alive?”

The next day, she didn’t leave the house at all. Just wandered from room to room, brushing her fingers along the walls, humming that tune under her breath. She didn’t eat. Didn’t speak. Just… hummed.

By the end of the week, I was losing it. I started hearing footsteps at night. Not hers—too heavy. I heard whispering in the vents. And every night at 3:03 a.m., the humming would return from under the floorboards. Sometimes… there was crying with it.

I had to know.

So I waited until Elena was deep in her humming trance upstairs. I pried up the living room floorboards. Dust and rot flew up. And underneath, in a shallow grave, I saw a body.

A woman.

Her skin paper-thin and gray. Her dress… Elena’s favorite green one. Her mouth was open like she died screaming, her throat packed with dirt.

Behind me, I heard the floor creak. I turned, and Elena was standing there.

Except it wasn’t my Elena anymore.

Her eyes were entirely black. Not metaphorically. Actually black—no whites, no pupils, just void. Her voice sounded doubled when she spoke, like two people were speaking in sync.

“You shouldn’t have looked,” she said. “You’re supposed to love me now.”

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. I tried to run, but she was already beside me. She kissed my forehead. Cold lips. And then everything went dark.

Now I’m here.

I don’t know how long it’s been. I lie beneath the floor, the dirt pressing into my chest. Every night, I hear her footsteps above me, and her humming.

She brought someone else home yesterday.

I can hear him screaming now.

Soon, he'll be humming too.
