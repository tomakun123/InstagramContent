The old apartment building's elevator groaned as I stepped inside, the metallic smell of worn machinery wafting up to greet me like an unwelcome friend. My footsteps echoed off the walls as I made my way to our floor, the fluorescent lights overhead flickering with a gentle malevolence. It was just another typical morning in this familiar place.

I'd lived in 3B for five years now, sharing the apartment with Emily since we met in college. She still worked from home as an accountant, her days spent hunched over spreadsheets on our cluttered kitchen table while I headed off to my job at a local bookstore. Our routine was comfortable, if not exactly exciting.

As I unlocked the door and stepped inside, I noticed the air felt heavier than usual, weighted down by something invisible. The scent of stale coffee lingered from last night's dinner, now mingled with the faint tang of decay – an aroma that seemed to cling to everything in this apartment like a bad habit. Emily sat at the table, her eyes fixed intently on the screen, fingers poised over the keyboard.

"Morning," she said distractedly, not looking up.

I nodded, dropping my bag onto the couch as I made my way to the kitchen for coffee. The pot was still half-full from last night's brew, and I poured myself a cup while Emily continued to work. Her expression grew more intense, brow furrowed in concentration.

As I sipped my coffee, I noticed something off about our living room. Not immediately apparent, but it nagged at me like a whispered secret: the bookshelf was slightly askew, one shelf slightly out of alignment with the others. It wasn't a big deal – just a small anomaly that only caught my attention because of the otherwise pristine order of our space.

I set the cup down and straightened the shelf, feeling a strange sense of satisfaction as the books aligned perfectly once more. Emily didn't seem to notice; she was too engrossed in her work. I shrugged it off, thinking it must have been just my imagination playing tricks on me.

The rest of the day passed uneventfully – we made lunch, watched some TV, and went for a walk around the block as the sun set behind the buildings. As night began to fall, Emily retreated back to her spreadsheets while I started reading in bed, trying to get lost in a good novel to shake off the lingering feeling of unease that had settled over me.

It wasn't until I heard the sound of our refrigerator humming that things took a turn for the strange – and disturbing. The noise was louder than usual, almost... wrong. A faint whirring vibration seemed to emanate from within, like something inside was struggling to free itself. My skin crawled as I sat up in bed, eyes fixed on the kitchen doorway.

Emily stood at the counter, her back turned toward me as she rummaged through the fridge for leftovers. She froze mid-movement, and I could sense a sudden stillness emanate from her – a silence that spoke louder than words. Slowly, she turned to face me, a look on her face that seemed almost... altered.

Her eyes had changed. The color, the shape – everything about them was different. They were no longer Emily's eyes at all, but something cold and alien, staring back at me with an unblinking gaze.

I froze in horror as she took a step closer, her presence filling the room like a dark, living shadow. I realized, too late, that our bookshelf had been out of alignment not because of my imagination or a minor oversight – but because it was trying to keep something from getting out.
