I stepped off the train at Ashwood Station, my eyes adjusting to the gray mist that shrouded the platform like a damp blanket. The air was heavy with the scent of rain-soaked earth and decaying leaves. I had been traveling for hours, but the familiar rhythms of this route made it feel almost home. Almost.

My grandmother's house loomed ahead, its Victorian facade softened by ivy tendrils that crawled up the walls like grasping fingers. The windows, usually ablaze with light, seemed dim and closed today, as if waiting for something to unfold within. A faint chill ran down my spine – not from the morning dew or the damp air, but a creeping sense of unease.

As I approached the house, a figure emerged from the doorway. My mother's cousin, Emma, her face pale and pinched, hovered on the threshold like a lost specter. Her eyes darted between me and the house as if searching for something that wasn't there. A faint tremble ran through her hands as she grasped the doorframe.

"Aunt Alice?" I asked, but Emma's gaze didn't settle on mine. "She's...she's in the kitchen," Emma stammered, releasing a nervous smile. "Making breakfast."

I entered the house, leaving Emma standing at the door like a sentinel. The air inside was stale and thick with the smell of baking bread – or something else, something sweetly decaying. In the kitchen, my grandmother stood at the counter, her back to me as she stirred a bubbling pot.

The liquid within seemed to writhe like living darkness, its surface disturbed by an unseen presence beneath. I felt an involuntary shiver as Grandma's hands moved with jerky, unnatural motions – not quite right, but impossible to place why. The spoon in her hand looked like a strange, makeshift tool, its edge worn and frayed.

"Aunt Alice?" I called out again, but she didn't turn around.

Emma slipped into the kitchen behind me, her voice barely above a whisper: "She's been...different lately." Her eyes flickered to the bubbling pot as if recalling something unpleasant. The spoon in Grandma's hand began to move more quickly now – almost frantically – as if trying to mix or stir away some unseen horror.

As I watched, transfixed, Grandma's hands suddenly froze mid-motion, her head cocked toward the window like a listening animal. Outside, a faint scratching sound rose from beyond the mist-shrouded garden: a relentless scuttling, like fingernails on glass.

The kitchen grew colder and darker as if some unseen presence had stepped into our midst – not to join us, but to lurk just out of sight, waiting for an opening. And then, in the instant I turned toward Emma's face, I saw it: a single thread, thin as a spider's web, dangling from her lower lip like a strand of dark, glistening silk.

It was then that I realized my grandmother had been dead for three days – and Emma, too, was long gone, consumed by some creeping, insidious horror that coursed through the very walls of this house.
