I stepped into the worn creak of our apartment building's front door, its familiarity already starting to fray at the edges as I made my way up the stairs. The smell of stale air clung to me like a damp shroud. My grandmother's old apartment on the second floor was always where we ended up for family visits – not just because it felt like home but also because it never felt quite... right.

Today, my aunt had insisted I come help sort through Grandma's belongings after her passing. Her passing. It still felt like a dream, and I'd rather have stuck with the numbing haze of grief than face whatever was waiting in that apartment. But here I was.

The door creaked open beneath my hand, the familiar scent of pipe tobacco wafting out – Grandma used to smoke those awful cigars on her balcony when she was feeling particularly cantankerous. The air inside felt heavy with an almost imperceptible vibration, like the hum of a distant engine that only I could hear.

I walked in and began methodically going through her dresser drawers, taking care not to disturb the neatly stacked piles of clothes or photographs. My aunt hovered behind me, occasionally whispering instructions or offering memories about Grandma's peculiarities. These were the kind of conversations we'd always had around this place – hushed whispers, half-forgotten anecdotes, and that faint feeling of unease.

As I worked through the top drawer, my fingers brushed against something strange: a small, intricately carved wooden box with an odd symbol etched into its lid. The symbol looked... familiar? But I couldn't quite place it. A shiver ran down my spine as I carefully picked up the box and turned it over in my hands.

"Is this...?" I started to ask but trailed off when I noticed my aunt's expression had changed – a subtle shift from sympathetic concern to something almost like... curiosity?

"Aunt, do you know anything about this?"

My aunt's eyes drifted away from mine, her gaze snagging on some point in the distance. "You'll find that in your grandmother's papers," she said finally.

Papers? I didn't recall seeing any papers around here before. But when I opened the second drawer, a scattered mess of files and documents spilled out onto the floor. Scanning through them quickly, I noticed that some of these papers were dated... backwards.

The next few hours passed in a blur as we sifted through the belongings, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was very wrong here – something my aunt seemed to know more about than she let on.

As night began to fall outside, casting long shadows into Grandma's apartment, I finally found myself back in front of the wooden box. It now sat on the kitchen counter, its symbol etched into my mind like a branding iron.

I decided it was time for some answers.

"Aunt," I said softly as she stood nearby, "can we talk about this?"

The room fell silent except for the soft creaking of the old apartment building's wooden floorboards beneath our feet. And then, with a quiet deliberateness that sent shivers down my spine, my aunt leaned in and began to date her own signature into one of Grandma's papers.

A date that was before the birthdate listed on the same page.

The realization hit me like a cold slap: this apartment building had been constructed... backwards. The entire story – our family, Grandma, all these memories – it was being rewritten, chronologically reversed. And with every passing moment, I felt myself being pulled into some nightmarish reality where time itself was unraveling.
