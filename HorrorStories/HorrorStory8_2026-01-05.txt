 I stepped out of my car and onto the cracked asphalt of the neighborhood's oldest residential street. The trees, once lush and vibrant, now stood as skeletal sentinels, their branches etched against the pale sky like bony fingers. I'd been back in town for three days, trying to sort through the remnants of my grandmother's estate. The house had been empty since her passing six months prior, its grand Victorian facade shrouded in a perpetual layer of dust.

As I walked up the path, the crunch of gravel beneath my feet was the only sound that broke the oppressive silence. My phone buzzed with an incoming text from Emily, my childhood friend who'd offered to help me sort through the house's contents. "Meet you inside," her message read. I nodded to myself, though there was no one to see.

The front door creaked as I pushed it open, its hinges screeching in protest. The air inside was stale and heavy, like a physical presence that clung to me. Cobwebs hung from the chandelier above, delicate threads that trembled in the faint breeze created by my entrance. I breathed deeply, trying to shake off the feeling of unease.

The interior of the house was just as I remembered it – cluttered with antique furniture and faded photographs on every available surface. Emily arrived a few minutes later, her bright smile faltering as she took in the atmosphere. "It's like...time stood still," she said, trailing off.

We spent the next hour sorting through my grandmother's belongings, but it was during our break that I noticed something odd. In the kitchen, where we'd set up a makeshift table to sort through books and papers, there was a single plate with a cup of cold tea beside it. The liquid had gone stagnant, its surface reflecting the faint light like still water.

I pointed out the abandoned meal to Emily, and she furrowed her brow in concern. "That's weird," she said, though we both knew it didn't feel right. We decided to leave it as is, reasoning that my grandmother might have left it intentionally for some unknown reason.

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the room as we continued our task. I tried to focus on categorizing books and documents, but Emily's presence was a distraction. She kept glancing at me with an expression of growing unease.

It was during this interlude that I caught a glimpse of something through the kitchen window – my grandmother, standing in her backyard garden, her eyes fixed on some point beyond the fence. Her posture was frozen, as if suspended mid-movement. I felt a shiver run down my spine and quickly looked away, dismissing it as a trick of the light.

As the afternoon wore on, Emily's demeanor changed. She grew quieter, her movements more hesitant. It became clear that she'd noticed something too – perhaps the same thing I had seen from afar. We continued working in silence, our hands moving over papers and books with an air of false normalcy.

Finally, as we were about to pack up for the day, Emily spoke up in a barely audible whisper. "Your grandmother left," she said, her eyes darting towards the kitchen window. I followed her gaze, expecting to see something – anything – that would explain what was happening. But there was nothing except the stillness of an empty house.

It was then that I noticed it: on the kitchen counter, where we'd set up our makeshift table, was a fresh plate with a steaming cup of tea beside it. The liquid inside seemed to ripple and shimmer in the fading light, as if stirred by an invisible hand.
