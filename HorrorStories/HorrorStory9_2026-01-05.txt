 I woke to darkness, the weight of it pressing against my eyelids like a physical force. My apartment's curtains were closed, as always, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The air inside felt heavy, stale, and when I rolled over to check the clock on my nightstand, I noticed the time read 6:47 AM – an hour earlier than usual. 

The previous evening's events swirled in a haze. I had gone out for a run around the neighborhood, but now, walking to the kitchen to grab a glass of water, nothing seemed to fit into place. The trees outside my window were bare and twisted, their branches grasping toward the sky like skeletal fingers. Sunlight would be hitting them by now – it should be bright and warm, but the room remained shrouded in an unnatural gloom.

I lit the stove for coffee, waiting for it to brew as I stared out the kitchen window. The neighbor's house across the lawn was quiet; Mrs. Jenkins usually had her curtains open by this time, but today they hung still and closed like a secret kept from me. My gaze drifted to the fence that separated our properties – weathered wood with a fresh coat of paint last summer.

Mrs. Jenkins' presence in my life had grown more pronounced over the past few months. She would appear at my door unannounced, bearing baked goods or asking if I'd like her to mow my lawn (the one she took care of herself). Her mannerisms were always polite and friendly, yet there was something... off about them – a hint of an undertone that made me feel uneasy.

The coffee machine beeped, breaking the spell. I poured myself a cup and sat down at the kitchen table, trying to piece together what I'd done the night before. It wasn't until my mind cleared, however, that I noticed something strange: on the counter next to the coffee maker lay an envelope addressed to me in Mrs. Jenkins' handwriting.

The letter inside read:

"Dear [Name],

I've made sure you're taken care of."

That was it – no further explanation or signature. My skin crawled as I folded the paper and tucked it back into its envelope, unsure what to make of this new development.

Over the next few hours, the weather shifted outside; gray clouds gave way to a soft blue sky with puffy white clouds that seemed almost... unnatural. The air remained heavy, though – an unshakeable sense of foreboding hung like a dark presence over my apartment. 

As I worked on my laptop in front of the window, Mrs. Jenkins appeared at the back door, a tray bearing a plate of fresh-baked cookies and a pitcher of cold milk. Her smile was as warm and inviting as ever; however, it seemed to carry an undercurrent of something else – something sinister.

I took a cookie from the tray without looking up, trying to maintain my composure as she hovered nearby. My gaze drifted back to her hands, which held the plate with a grip that seemed almost... deliberate.

It was then I noticed the paint on Mrs. Jenkins' house across the lawn: it had changed – gone from last summer's fresh coat of white to an eerie, mirror-like finish, reflecting the sky outside as if it were glass. And as I stared at this image, I realized with a jolt that my own apartment's walls seemed to be mirroring the same effect.
