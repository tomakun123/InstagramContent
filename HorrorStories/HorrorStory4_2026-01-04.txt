I woke to the sound of rain pattering against my windowpane, each drop echoing like a drumbeat in the stillness. The morning light, usually bright and cheerful, had given way to an overcast grey that seemed to swallow everything whole. I shivered, not from cold but from the feeling of being watched. It was just my imagination, I told myself.

After dressing in the dimly lit bathroom, I headed downstairs to start breakfast. The smell of fresh coffee wafted through the air, momentarily lifting my spirits. My grandmother's old radio sat on the kitchen counter, its dial spinning as if searching for a station that would never come. It was an odd habit of hers – always leaving it on even when there was no one home to listen.

I cracked eggs into a bowl and began whisking them with a wooden spoon while staring out the window at our small garden. The plants seemed parched, their leaves wilted from the lack of sunlight. I thought about watering them later but put off the task for now. My grandmother used to say that some things needed their rest, just like people did.

The kitchen was quiet except for the rain's steady beat and the occasional groan of the old wooden floorboards beneath my feet. It was as if the house itself was sighing, trying to shake off the weight of years gone by. My grandmother had been gone three weeks now – a sudden illness that took her away in an instant. Her passing left me with this empty space and the feeling of being alone.

I poured the egg mixture into a hot pan, watching as it sizzled and spat. The kitchen's familiarity brought back memories of helping my grandmother cook on Sundays. Those were simple times, filled with laughter and warmth. But today felt different – oppressive, like the rain outside had seeped into every pore of this house.

As I cooked, my mind wandered to the attic above me, where boxes stacked haphazardly held remnants of our family's history. Old photographs, yellowed letters tied with twine, and dusty trinkets all waited to be sorted through but never were. My grandmother had always told me it was too soon to tackle those memories.

The eggs were done; I slid them onto a plate and took my first bite. The taste was flat – not quite spoiled but lacking the vitality that made food enjoyable. It was then that I noticed something peculiar: on the kitchen table, where we usually placed our breakfast plates, lay a single eggshell with no yolk to be found. Where had it come from? And why?

I turned back to my plate, my eyes tracing the contours of the room as if searching for an explanation. But there was none – just the rain's relentless drumming and the feeling that something inside me had shifted, ever so slightly.
