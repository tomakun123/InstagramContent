I wake up to the sound of rain pattering against my windowpane, drumming out a relentless beat that seems to match the rhythm of my heart. It's been three days since I moved into this apartment in Ravenswood, a small complex on the outskirts of town. The place is clean and functional, but it feels...off. Not unpleasantly so, exactly – more like a faint hum or vibration beneath the surface.

I step out of bed and pad across the floor to the kitchen, flipping on the light above the counter. A droplet of water clings to the edge of my glass as I pour myself some tap water from the filter pitcher. It's an odd thing about this apartment: the water tastes like it comes from a natural spring, but with none of that telltale earthy flavor. Instead, it's almost...neutral.

My landlord, Mrs. Jenkins, had warned me that the pipes might be older than they appear. "Nothing to worry about," she said with an encouraging smile. But I'm starting to wonder if there's something more to it. The way the light reflects off the surfaces seems different here – not brighter or dimmer, but...angled in some way.

I take a sip of my water and glance around the kitchen. It's still early; the sky outside is a dull gray that promises rain all day. My phone buzzes on the counter with an incoming text from Mom: "Hey kiddo, how's the new place?" I respond quickly, trying to shake off this feeling of disquiet.

As I scroll through my social media feed, a post from my friend Alex catches my eye – he's been going on about some local urban legend involving Ravenswood. Apparently, people who live here start to...lose themselves in their own reflections? The idea is laughable, but it nags at me like a tick.

I try to shake the thought and focus on getting ready for work, which involves walking to the nearby university campus. It's about a 20-minute stroll through quiet streets lined with old trees that seem to lean in, as if sharing some secret. I pass by the same few pedestrians every day – Mrs. Jenkins' niece, who always waves from across the street; and Mr. Patel, who owns the Indian restaurant down the block.

The university itself is a maze of concrete and glass, filled with students rushing to class or huddled over their laptops in the library. My office is on the third floor, which has windows that look out onto the parking lot and the adjacent woods. Those trees seem to loom over me when I glance up from my work.

Today's been uneventful – just a standard day of grading papers and attending a departmental meeting. When it wraps up around 4 pm, I pack up my things and step outside into the rain, which has turned into a light drizzle by now.

As I walk back to Ravenswood, something feels off. The trees seem closer than before – their branches like grasping fingers in the fading light. And then there's this water taste, which refuses to leave my tongue. It's as if...I'm drinking from something that's not quite here.

When I step inside my apartment, Mrs. Jenkins is waiting for me by the door with a concerned look on her face. "You're starting to notice things, aren't you?" she asks softly. I nod, feeling like an idiot. She hands me a small glass filled with water from the filter pitcher and tells me it's fine – that it will take some time getting used to.

But as I raise the glass to my lips, I catch a glimpse of myself in the window reflection behind her...and see another person standing right next to me – someone who looks just like me.
