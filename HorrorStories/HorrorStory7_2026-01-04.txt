I woke up to an unfamiliar smell - acrid, like burnt plastic, but sweeter. My apartment, our apartment, smelled of stale coffee and yesterday's pizza. I rolled onto my side, rubbing the sleep from my eyes. The clock on my nightstand read 6:47 AM.

My partner, Emily, was already up, making breakfast in the kitchen. She called out to me through the thin walls, her voice a gentle hum as she moved around the small space. Our apartment's layout had never bothered us - it felt cozy, intimate - but now, with this smell and Emily's murmurs, I sensed something off.

As I swung my legs over the side of the bed, the creaking of the mattress echoed through the room like a dying sigh. My skin prickled; I felt exposed. The air in here was thick, heavy, and it made me want to gasp. It took an effort to stand up, as if the weight of the day was already bearing down on me.

Emily's voice called out again, this time with a hint of concern. "Hey, are you okay?" She stood in the doorway, her hair tied back in a loose knot, and a spatula in one hand. Her eyes were narrowed, watching me as I stumbled towards the kitchen.

I forced a smile onto my face. "Yeah, yeah... just tired."

The smell followed us into the kitchen, clung to our breakfast like a bad omen. We ate in silence, exchanging glances that said we both knew something was wrong - but what?

Emily's phone buzzed on the counter, a soft vibration against the ceramic tile. She picked it up, scanned the screen, and then quickly stuffed it back into her pocket.

"What is it?" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

"Nothing," she said hastily. "Just work stuff."

We finished our breakfast in silence, the air between us heavy with unspoken words. My eyes drifted around the apartment - at the small bookshelf where we kept our favorite books; at the framed photos on the wall; and at the worn couch that seemed to sag under its own weight.

Later that morning, I decided to take a walk outside. The streets were quiet, but not empty. There was always someone walking somewhere, doing something - in this case, they were all staring up at our apartment building as if mesmerized by some invisible force.

Emily stayed inside, muttering excuses about needing to "catch up" on work. I didn't press her; I knew she wasn't hiding anything from me... or so it seemed.

When I returned home, the smell had intensified - now an overpowering stench like burnt rubber and grease. My stomach churned. I made my way back to the kitchen, searching for some sign of what was causing this reek, but everything looked normal.

It wasn't until I opened our small pantry that I saw it: a container of old cooking oil with a cracked lid. On closer inspection, I realized that the crack wasn't just a hairline fracture - it was an uneven rip, as if something had gnawed through the plastic.

I called out to Emily, my voice shaking now. "Honey? Do you know how this got here?"

She appeared beside me in the pantry, her eyes wide and her face pale. For a moment, we just stared at each other - the air between us thick with something akin to terror.

And then she spoke: "I didn't put it there."

In that instant, I understood what was wrong about our apartment - not just the smell or the creaking floorboards, but everything. The whole place felt... used, like a tool had been left out after a job well done.
