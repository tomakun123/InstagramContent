I woke to the sound of rain on my roof, the rhythmic beat like a metronome counting down the seconds until I'd have to leave for work. My apartment was quiet, except for the creaking of the old wooden floorboards beneath me as I swung my legs over the side of the bed. The morning light filtered through the blinds, casting a faintly yellow glow on the walls.

I lived in a small building in the heart of town, surrounded by shops and restaurants that seemed to cater to every whim. But from my window, all I saw was a narrow alleyway leading out into the grayness beyond. The rain made it look like a miniature river, churning with an otherworldly energy.

My name is Emily, and I'd been living in this apartment for nearly three years now. It was my sanctuary, a place where I could escape the world outside and lose myself in books or sleep. But lately, things had started to feel...off. Small things at first: a misplaced book, an unexplained chill on a warm day, a faint scent of something decaying that I couldn't quite place.

This morning was no different. As I got dressed and headed for the kitchen, I noticed that my coffee mug was on the wrong side of the sink. I must have put it there last night after washing up, but my mind drew a blank when trying to recall doing so. It wasn't much, but it was enough to nudge me into a feeling of unease.

I grabbed my bag and headed out into the rain-soaked streets, weaving through pedestrians who seemed to be in a hurry to get somewhere. At the office, things were quiet too – just the usual hum of computers and muted conversations. My coworkers barely noticed my arrival, but then again, I often felt invisible there.

The hours ticked by at a snail's pace, until finally it was lunchtime. I decided to walk to that new sandwich shop that had opened up on Elm Street. The rain had let up, and the sun broke through the clouds just as I turned onto my street. But something about the scene before me jarred – a woman standing outside the shop, staring at nothing in particular.

She didn't seem to be watching the world go by; she seemed to be watching herself. Her face was expressionless, but there was something in her eyes that made my skin crawl. I felt an urge to turn around and get back to the office, but curiosity kept me rooted to the spot.

The woman looked up as if sensing my presence, and our gazes met for a fleeting instant. In that moment, I could've sworn she mouthed a single word: "Mine."

I turned and hurried away from her, heart racing in my chest. Back at the office, I found myself staring blankly at my computer screen, replaying the encounter over and over in my mind.

Later, as I walked home through the drizzly evening, I noticed something else – a small note taped to my front door, written in a childlike scrawl: "Welcome home." My heart sank. The rain pattered on, relentless, as I entered my apartment and saw that everything was exactly as it had been before.

But then, I spotted the coffee mug on the wrong side of the sink once more.
