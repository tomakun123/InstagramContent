Hello, my name is Thomas, a student at New York University, and I loved your story on r/nosleep titled " ". I found it to be really well written and I was wondering if I could use it on my Instagram account. It is called St0riesofreddit and I primarily post r/nosleep posts but also some of my own work. I of course will provide credit, usually with this format:

Credit:
User: [reddit username/instagram username]
URL: [URL to reddit post]

I would absolutely love to have your story on my account so please let me know, and if you have any requests for the credit such as your instagram username, also let me know!
