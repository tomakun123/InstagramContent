When my sister Ava came home from the asylum, the first thing I noticed was her silence. Not just the kind of quiet that trauma brings—this was deeper, heavier. Like something was pressing on her throat from the inside.

She didn’t blink. Not once, not even in sleep. She’d lie on her bed with her eyes wide open, unseeing yet alert, as if watching something only she could see crawl along the ceiling. Mom called it medication side effects. Dad said we needed to be patient. But even our dog growled at her door at night and refused to enter her room.

Ava didn’t eat. Not one bite. We'd all sit around the table, pretending not to notice her full plate while her stomach growled. Except… it wasn’t growling. It was clicking. Like dozens of tiny bones snapping in sequence beneath her skin. We thought she was starving.

We were wrong.

She started gaining weight—fast. Not evenly either. Just in her belly. It stretched tight and round, twitching sometimes like there was something inside, shifting. Growing. Our parents laughed nervously and said it was her body adjusting. But I saw their faces when they thought I wasn’t looking. Fear, edged with denial.

Then came the smell.

Like rot and copper pennies, seeping from her room in the dead of night. One morning I woke to find a trail of red-brown smears down the hallway, leading from her door to the basement. Dad said it was old plumbing. But the next night, I followed it.

Ava was in the basement, naked under the buzzing light. Her skin was pale, too pale, as if it had been drained. Her arms were lifted, fingers twitching in midair like a puppet tangled in invisible strings. Something moved beneath the surface of her belly, bulging outward, then retracting. And that’s when I saw the seam.

It wasn’t a wound. It wasn’t a scar. It was a mouth. A vertical slit just under her sternum, lined with glistening, twitching tissue. It slowly peeled open as I watched, revealing something wet and white and jointed—like a hand, only too thin, too many fingers, each ending in a hooked, translucent claw.

I ran.

But the thing saw me. Not Ava. The thing inside her.

After that night, Ava never left the basement.

Then Mom disappeared.

Dad went next.

I told the police. They found blood, but no bodies. Just skins. Neatly flayed, folded like pressed shirts, each one with the face peeled back like a hood. They said wild animals might’ve gotten in. They didn’t check the attic.

That’s where I’ve been living. For three weeks now.

Watching.

Waiting.

I see her at night, wandering the house. She doesn’t look like Ava anymore. The skin fits wrong, hangs loose at the shoulders, stitched back together with black thread in places. Her eyes don’t move. But her stomach does. I see the outline of its face sometimes, pressing against her flesh from the inside—like a baby kicking. Only this thing smiles.

Last night she stood beneath the attic door and whispered, "You're next."

My stomach has been twitching all day.

And just now, I heard a click inside me.
